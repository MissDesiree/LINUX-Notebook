Give Yourself Access, Block Others
Letâ€™s say you only want yourself to have access (read and write), but no one else.

bash

chmod 600 sam
ls -l sam
Output:

bash

-rw------- 1 user user 0 date sam
This command:

Gives you rw (6)

Gives group and others --- (0)

This is one of the most common settings for configuration files like .ssh/id_rsa.
