I’m Learning Linux and It’s Everywhere

Right now, I am learning Linux as part of my journey in information technology. At first, I thought Linux was just for people who worked with servers or large computer systems. I imagined it being used only in data centers or by people who write code all day. But as I started learning, I was surprised to find out that Linux is everywhere around us, even in things we use every single day.

Linux is an open-source operating system. That means it is free for anyone to use, change, or build on. It gives people and companies more control over how they use technology. Because of this freedom, many businesses and developers choose Linux over other systems. It is also very reliable and secure, which makes it a strong choice for all kinds of devices.

For example, Linux is used in smartphones, tablets, websites, and smart TVs. It is even found in airplanes, Wi-Fi routers, and appliances like washing machines and refrigerators that have screens and smart functions. Linux is the hidden engine behind many of the gadgets and machines we use every day, and most people do not even realize it.

As I continue to study Linux, I am learning how it works under the surface. I am practicing basic commands in the terminal, learning how the file system is organized, and exploring how Linux is used on servers. At first, it was a little hard to understand, but each day I feel more confident. I now see how important Linux is for careers in IT, especially in fields like cybersecurity, cloud computing, and network management.

What inspires me the most is knowing that these skills can help me in the real world. Linux is not just for big companies. It is used in small businesses, healthcare, schools, and even cars. The more I learn, the more I want to keep going. I see now that Linux is not just an operating system, it is a powerful tool that helps keep the modern world running.

This is just the beginning for me, but I am proud to be learning something that has such a big role in technology today. I will continue sharing my progress and encouraging others who want to start their tech journey too.
