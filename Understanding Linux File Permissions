Understanding Linux File Permissions
Ever wondered how Linux keeps your files safe from prying eyes? It’s all in the permissions.

Linux is a multi-user system, which means many users can access the same system. To keep your files private, Linux gives every file and directory three types of permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x).

These permissions are controlled at three levels:

User (u) – The file owner

Group (g) – A group of users

Others (o) – Everyone else

When you run the command ls -l, you’ll see a line like this:

-rw-rw-r-- 1 user group  0 Jun 14 12:00 jerry.txt
This tells you:

It's a file (-)

The owner and group can read and write

Others can only read

This system lets you control exactly who can do what with your files, protecting your environment from mistakes or misuse.
