# 3 Easy Ways to Create Files in Linux (For Beginners)

If you're learning Linux, one of the first things you'll need to know is how to create files. Here are three simple ways to do that from the command line.

## 1. Use `touch` to Create Empty Files

```bash
touch filename
```

Example:

```bash
touch Jerry
```

This creates an empty file named `Jerry`.

## 2. Use `cp` to Create a New File from an Existing File

```bash
cp source_file destination_file
```

Example:

```bash
cp Jerry Lex
```

This copies the contents of `Jerry` into a new file called `Lex`.

## 3. Use `vi` or `vim` to Create and Edit Files

```bash
vi Homer
```

To save and exit:

* Press `Esc`
* Type `:wq!`
* Hit `Enter`

This creates a new file called `Homer`.

## Verify Your Files

```bash
ls -ltr
```

This command shows files sorted by time, with the newest files at the bottom.

✅ Now you’ve learned how to create files in 3 different ways. Practice by making your own files and see the results using `ls -ltr`.
