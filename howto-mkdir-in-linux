# How to Make Directories in Linux (Using `mkdir`)

Creating folders (directories) in Linux is easy with the `mkdir` command. Here's how to do it.

## Step 1: Check Where You Are

```bash
pwd
```

Make sure you're in your home directory or a location where you have permission to create folders.

## Step 2: Create a Single Directory

```bash
mkdir Seinfeld
```

This creates a folder named `Seinfeld`.

## Step 3: Create Multiple Directories at Once

```bash
mkdir Superman Simpson
```

This creates both `Superman` and `Simpson` directories in one line.

## Step 4: Check Your Work

```bash
ls -ltr
```

You’ll see the new directories listed at the bottom. Some systems show directories in a different color to make them easier to spot.

⚠️ **Note:** If you try to create directories in system folders like `/etc`, you’ll get a permission error. Only the root user can create files there.
