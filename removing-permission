Removing All Permissions in Linux
Want to lock a file completely? Try this:

bash

chmod 000 sam
ls -l sam
Output:

bash
Copy
Edit
---------- 1 user user 0 date sam
This means:

No one (not even the owner) can read, write, or execute the file without sudo

This is useful when you want to protect sensitive files from accidental edits or viewing.
