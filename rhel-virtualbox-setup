Installing Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) for RHCSA Practice
This post outlines the steps I followed to install RHEL in a VirtualBox virtual machine as part of my RHCSA 30-day challenge.

Step 1: Register for a Red Hat Developer Account
Go to Red Hat Developer and create a free account. This gives you access to download RHEL and use it for learning purposes.

Step 2: Download the RHEL ISO File
After signing in, go to the "Downloads" section and choose "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9." Select the x86_64 architecture ISO file. This file will be used to install the OS in VirtualBox.

Step 3: Install Oracle VirtualBox
If you don't have VirtualBox installed, download it from virtualbox.org. Install it on your computer to run the virtual machine.

Step 4: Create a New Virtual Machine
Open VirtualBox and click “New.”

Name your machine (e.g., RedHat-VirtualMachine)

Set the type to Linux and version to Red Hat (64-bit)

Allocate at least 2048 MB (2 GB) of RAM

Create a virtual hard disk (recommended size: 20 GB or more)

Step 5: Attach the RHEL ISO to Your VM
Go to your VM’s Settings
Click “Storage”
Click the empty disk under Controller: IDE
Select “Choose a disk file” and browse to your downloaded RHEL ISO
Click OK

Step 6: Start the Virtual Machine
Click Start
Your VM will boot from the ISO
Follow the on-screen instructions to install Red Hat Linux (language, keyboard, installation destination, user setup)

Once installed, you’ll be able to log into your RHEL system and start running RHCSA practice commands using the terminal
